### Hi there 👋

- 👩🏼‍🚒 I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) advised by [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and [Weijie J. Su](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/).
- 👯 I'm affiliated with the [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu) and the [Statistics Department](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu).
- 🔭 My research has two themes: understanding deep neural nets and causality (commonsense causality and potential-outcomes frameworks) in natural languages.
